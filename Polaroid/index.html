					The Polaroid story
				</h2>
				<span class="story_span"></span>
				<p class="story">
					In an interview with Life magazine in 1972, the American scientist Edwin Land explained that he had invented one-step instant photography during a family vacation in 1944, when his daughter Jennifer had asked why she couldn’t see the pictures she had just taken “now”. It would be another three years before he realised his vision, but a child’s question launched research that would alter the photographic landscape for decades to come.
				</p> 
				<p class="story_two">
					Land was an inventor with 535 patents to his name. Once he and his former Harvard physics lecturer, George Wheelwright, had worked out how to manufacture it commercially, they made Polaroid Light Polarizing Filters for the Eastman Kodak Company. This was 1934, and the Polaroid Corporation was formed three years later.

				<p class="jobpro_txt txt">
					 As its name suggests, the Polaroid 600 Job Pro was originally designed for professionals – specifically, for construction sites (hence the bright, safety yellow). But that doesn't mean you can't have some fun with it. Those bright colors mean you'll have no problem getting people's attention, and its durable design means it's ready for whatever you throw at it. Except maybe a sledgehammer.

						With its unique shape, rubber binocular grips and pop-up flash, the Polaroid Impulse might be the oddball of the 600 family, but it’s got a certain charm about it. Its rugged design makes it perfect for anyone with a habit of bumping into things, and the automatic flash makes it ideal for late nights and parties. Just don’t drop it in the punch bowl, it’s not that tough.

					<p class="SX-70_txt txt">The Polaroid SX-70 is one of the most famous vintage instant cameras in the world. It was the first instant SLR camera ever made, and the first to use Polaroid’s now-iconic instant film which brought photos to life the moment they left the camera. Its manual controls have made it the go-to camera for artists and dreamers alike, and its fold-down design means you can take it with you, wherever you go. And trust us, you’ll want to.</p>
